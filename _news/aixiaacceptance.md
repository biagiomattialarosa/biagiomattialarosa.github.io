Happy to share I have two accepted papers at AIxIA 2021:  
1. *"Detection Accuracy for Evaluating Compositional Explanations of Units"* (preprint <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07804">here</a>).  
2. *"A Discussion about Explainable Inference on Sequential Data via Memory-Tracking"* (based on our IJCAI paper).
