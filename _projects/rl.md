**Goal:** The goal of this research area is to explore the application of explanation methods in deep reinforcement learning (e.g., games). This represents one of the least studied and most challenging settings in eXplainable Artificial Intelligence. Research topics include policy extraction, policy summarization, self-interpretable deep reinforcement learning, and self-interpretable deep learning guided by reinforcement learning.
