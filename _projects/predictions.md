This page provides a summary sheet that includes the general goal, reference papers (both mine and external) for an overview of the topic, as well as the domains explored so far. We are also interested in extending the applications of these techniques beyond their traditional domains. If you have expertise in other areas (e.g., neuroscience, gaming, or audio/speech modeling), we would be happy to explore potential extensions into those fields.

**Goal:** The goal of this research area is to understand the motivations behind specific predictions of a deep neural network. This is the first and the most extensively studied area in eXplainable Artificial Intelligence. While the field has strong baselines for common domains (Vision and NLP), my research aims to explore the limitations of current methods in understudied and specific domains.

**Domains:** NLP, Robot Navigation.
