I am available to mentor students on topics related to eXplainable Artificial Intelligence. I welcome both local students and international or out-of-country students (via remote meetings) at any level—undergraduate, master’s, or PhD. Mentoring and project guidance will be tailored to your goals, interests, and background. I strongly encourage women, first-generation students, and individuals from underrepresented groups to reach out if interested.

There are several available projects listed on the <a href="/projects/">PROJECTS PAGE</a>, but I am also happy to support your ideas if you already have a specific project in mind. If you are new to eXplainable Artificial Intelligence or unsure where to begin, I recommend reading the descriptions of each research area on the <a href="/projects/">PROJECTS PAGE</a> and identifying the one that excites you the most. To gain a deeper understanding, consider reading one of the reference papers (reading the abstract, introduction, and figures is sufficient).

If you are interested in my supervision, please **first complete** <a href="https://forms.gle/FNVsEGshxqyBY1i19">FORM1</a> and <a href="https://forms.gle/U2uwV2M65jVCutRaA">FORM2</a>, **and then** email me with the subject line `[mentoring]`. In the email include some information about yourself, your interests, the research area you’d like to work on, and the name used in the forms. Note that the forms are not used to evaluate you or to filter out students but to align your and our expectation and philosophy. I typically respond within a couple of days.
