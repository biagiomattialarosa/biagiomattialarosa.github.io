I am a Postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/">University of California, Santa Cruz</a>, and a member of the <a href="https://aiea-lab.github.io/">AIEA lab</a> led by Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=UFT_ijYAAAAJ&hl=it&oi=ao">Leilani Gilpin</a>. I earned my PhD in Computer Engineering from <a href="https://www.uniroma1.it/">Sapienza University of Rome</a>, where my dissertation was honored as one of the top 5% of the university. My PhD research was supervised by the amazing <a href="http://robertocapobianco.com/">Prof. Roberto Capobianco</a>. I earned an M.S. degree in "Artificial Intelligence and Robotics" under the guidance of <a href="http://robertocapobianco.com/">Prof. Roberto Capobianco</a> and a B.S. degree in "Computer Science" under the supervision of <a href="http://wwwusers.di.uniroma1.it/~navigli/"> Prof. Roberto Navigli</a>, both from Sapienza University of Rome.<br>

**Research**: I am mostly interested in theories, methodologies, and designs that make the most advanced AI techniques able to explain themselves. Specifically, I focus on foundational aspects of the emerging field of **explanatory deep neural networks**. My work typically integrates tools from adjacent fields (e.g., statistics, classical AI) with components embedded directly within deep neural networks to improve their interpretability. I am particularly interested in techniques that can be applied across diverse domains and interdisciplinary research. My research so far has investigated methods related to neuron analysis (mechanistic interpretability), memory-based networks, attention mechanisms, and novel designs for self-interpretable deep neural networks.

**Name Disclaimer**:  My preferred name is `Mattia`, but you are welcome to use Biagio if that is more convenient for you. Currently, I publish under the name Biagio La Rosa, but I don't exclude to use my preferred name for future publications.
